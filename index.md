# Districts of Fleurévielle
💐 Rosé Rive

The heart of the city — a romantic riverside boulevard with boutique cafés, couture ateliers, and floral markets on every corner. Lovers walk hand-in-hand beneath chandeliers strung between the trees.

🎠 Le Petit Parfum

A whimsical, carousel-inspired neighborhood known for its pastel bakeries, ribbon candy shops, and vintage perfume houses. The streets are scented, and the air sparkles faintly with sugar dust.

🪞 The Couture Quarter

Where fashion is born. Home to the Maison de Muses, an elite fashion school, and the Runway Royale — a pink marble street where daily fashion walks happen at golden hour. Every boutique here is a treasure chest.

🏰 Château Lune

The royal seat — a pink-pearl palace where the ruling Duchesse of Silk & Lace holds soirées under floating candlelight. The gardens bloom only in shades of blush, and the grand ballroom ceiling is painted with a sky that shifts between sunrise and sunset.
